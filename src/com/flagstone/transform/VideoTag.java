 * The VideoObject is the root class for objects that represent each of the
 * tagged data structures that make up the Flash Video file format 
 * specification.
 * 
 * <p>Each of the major data structures defined in the Flash Video (flv) file 
 * format specification starts with a header that contains the type identifying 
 * the data structure followed by the number of bytes that the body of the 
 * encoded data structure occupies in the file. A timestamp at which the audio
 * or video data will be played is also included. The VideoObject manages the 
 * encoding and decoding of this header information.</p>
