  Release Notes for Transform SWF, Version ${project.version}

  Bug Fixes
-------------

3082031. JPG files throw an exception.

   JPEG files where the image data contained an odd number of bytes would cause
   a overflow exception will be thrown by the JPGDecoder.
   
3088088. DefineButton2 does not execute actions.

   The actions in DefineButton2 are not executed. The problem is the way the 
   object is encoded. There is an offset, in bytes, that indicates the size of 
   the encoded button shape records. This offset was calculated incorrectly so 
   Flash Player did not load the event handlers for the button correctly. 
  
--------------
  Maven Site
--------------

1. Added content previously hosted on SourceForge using Trac into Maven site
   files. The combination of these files (project description, feature list 
   and code example) along with the pages generated from the Maven POM and 
   project reporting make up the project portal which is targeted at project
   developers with the main Flagstone web site targeting users of Transform.
