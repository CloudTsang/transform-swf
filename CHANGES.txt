  Release Notes for Transform SWF, Version ${project.version} 
-------------------------------------------------

Version 3.0 is a completely new version of the Transform SWF library that 
supports all versions of Flash up to and including Flash 10.

For the existing users of Transform SWF this version has the same approach of
providing a low-level API which exposes all the data structures in a Flash file. 
Files will still be generated and parsed in the same way. Although the code
has been heavily refactored and generally cleaned up porting code from 
Transform 2 should be very simple and extensive rewrites will not be
necessary.
