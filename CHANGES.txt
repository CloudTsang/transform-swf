  Release Notes for Transform SWF, Version ${project.version}

  Bug Fixes
-------------

1. JPG files throw an exception.

   JPEG files where the image data contained an odd number of bytes would cause
   a overflow exception will be thrown by the JPGDecoder.
   
2. DefineButton2 does not execute actions.

   The actions in DefineButton2 are not executed. The problem is the way the 
   object is encoded. There is an offset, in bytes, that indicates the size of 
   the encoded button shape records. This offset was calculated incorrectly so 
   Flash Player did not load the event handlers for the button correctly. 
   
3. BigDecoder.scanInt() throws an exception.

   If there were less than 2 or 3 bytes left in the internal buffer used by
   BigDecoder then it was not refilled and an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
   was thrown when looking ahead at the next 32-bits.
   
4. Corrected errors in PlayEventSound and PlayStreamingSound.

   Passing only the name of the file to be generated no longer throws an
   exception when testing to see if the parent directory exists.
  
-----------------
  Code Changes
-----------------

1. Cleaned up checkstyle and pmd warnings.

   The vast majority of CheckStyle and PMD warnings were resolved. Only warnings
   about magic numbers and data flow anomalies are left. These will be removed
   in due course.

-----------------
  Project Files
-----------------

1. Cleaned up checkstyle and pmd rules files.

   The checkstyle rules are now in checkstyle.xml while suppressions.xml has
   local changes for the project. Rule for PMD are stored in ruleset.xml. Only
   two rules have been disabled from the default ruleset:
   
   1. AvoidInstantiatingObjectsInLoops was disabled since loops are used to
      decode collections of objects.
   
   2. JUnitAssertionsShouldIncludeMessage was disabled to keep the tests as
      simple as possible. Also since most of the tests centre around encoding
      or decoding object attributes little would be gained by adding messages.
      
   There are still a few @SuppressWarnings annotations on individual classes 
   and these will be reviewed and fixed over time.
   
2. Renamed README.txt to README.md and re-formatted with markdown.

3. Simplified the Maven POM and removed site files.

   The simple structure of the repository on GitHub removes the need to
   maintain a set of site files describing the project. All the relevant 
   content was added to the new README.md file.
   
-------------
  Packaging
-------------

1. Simplified and renamed the dist assembly.

   The contents of the assembly, e.g. transform-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT-dist.zip was 
   simplified renamed to transform-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT-ant.zip. This contains only
   the source files and an ANT build file that contains targets to build the 
   JAR file (either using debug or optimised versions of the classes) and 
   generate the javadocs. The default target 'all' builds the jar file with 
   optimised classes and generates the javadocs.
